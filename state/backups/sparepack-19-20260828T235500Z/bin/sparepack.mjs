const USAGE = `sparepack — turn a slice of a private repo into a shareable task pack

  sparepack init                 write a commented sparepack.yaml to get started
  sparepack pack [--yes]         build a pack, show what it contains, ask before writing
  sparepack verify <dir>         re-check a built pack from scratch

Options
  -c, --config <path>   config file (default: ./sparepack.yaml)
  -o, --out <dir>       output directory (default: from config, else ./sparepack-out)
      --yes             skip the confirmation prompt (see the warning it prints)
      --allow-findings  build even with critical/high scan findings
      --no-color        plain output

sparepack is allowlist-only: nothing is published unless you named it.
`

const TEMPLATE = `# sparepack — what to hand a stranger, and nothing more.
#
# This file is an allowlist. There is no "exclude" key on purpose: "publish everything
# except..." means a file you never thought about gets published, and that is how leaks
# happen. Here, a file you never thought about stays home.

# One line. The worker reads this before anything else.
task: "Stream large CSV imports instead of loading the whole file into memory"

# Published byte for byte. Types, constants, contracts — things you would be comfortable
# posting publicly on their own.
include:
  - src/importer/types.ts

# Signatures and types are kept; every function body is replaced with a throwing stub.
# TypeScript and JavaScript only — sparepack refuses other languages rather than
# risk shipping their implementations unchanged.
interfaces:
  - src/importer/parser.ts

# The acceptance tests. These *are* the specification: if they pass, the task is done.
# A pack without tests puts the definition of "done" in prose, and disputes follow.
tests:
  - tests/importer/*.spec.ts

# Real structure, synthetic values. Generators: empty | shape[:n] | rows:n | text:n
#   shape  reads the real JSON and rebuilds it with fake values, same keys and nesting
#   rows   keeps a delimited file's header row and generates n fake data rows
fixtures:
  data/orders.json: shape:5

# Applied to every file before scanning. Use for names the scanner cannot know about:
# your company, internal project codenames, product names under NDA.
redact:
  - pattern: "acme-corp|ACME"
    replace: "example-org"

# Extra scan rules, on top of the built-in credential and PII patterns.
# scanRules:
#   - id: internal-service
#     pattern: "\\\\b(billing|ledger)-internal\\\\b"
#     severity: high

# Strip a leading path prefix from destination paths inside the pack.
# Useful when running from a monorepo root to avoid paths like "packages/api/src/...".
# stripPrefix: packages/api/

# Findings you have looked at and decided are fine. Format: rule-id:path[:line]
# Do not add entries here to make the scanner quiet. Add them when you have read the
# specific line and concluded it is genuinely safe to publish.
# allowFindings:
#   - email:src/importer/types.ts:12

Edit it, then run "sparepack pack". Two things worth knowing before you do:

  - Only what you list gets published. Patterns that match nothing are an error,
    not a silent no-op, because a typo would otherwise ship less than you meant.
  - You will be shown every file and asked to confirm before anything is written.`)
